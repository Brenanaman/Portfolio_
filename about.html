       <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm Brennan Tuma, a passionate graphic designer with a love for brand design and typography. My journey into the world of design began back in high school, where I first dabbled in creating graphics for a school news club. It wasn’t until community college, though, that I truly fell in love with the craft. There, I honed my skills, explored my creativity, and realized that design was more than just a hobby – it was my calling.<br>
        <br>
        I’m particularly drawn to the art of brand design because it’s about more than just aesthetics; it’s about telling a story and making a connection. Typography, with its ability to convey tone and emotion, is another one of my obsessions. Whether I’m crafting a logo, refining a layout, or experimenting with type, I’m always striving to create designs that resonate and inspire.<br>
        <br>
        When I’m not immersed in design work, you’ll find me unwinding in a few of my favorite ways: reading a great book, hanging out with friends and family, diving into a video game adventure, or relaxing at home with my cat, BatCat. These moments recharge my creativity and keep me inspired.<br>
        <br>
        Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of my favorite projects. I’d love to hear from you if you’re interested in working together or just want to connect.
    </p>
